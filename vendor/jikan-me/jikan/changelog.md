### 0.1.4 alpha - May 16, 17
- Jikan library is renamed from **mal-uapi.php** to **jikan.php**
- Namespace changed from **MAL** to **Jikan**
	```php
	$jikan = new \Jikan\GET;
	$jikan->anime(1);
	$anime = $jikan->data;
	```
- Main class is changed from **GET** to **Get**
- Completed person fetch
- Added canonical link for Characters in the return data
- Fixed parsing of related anime bug
- Here's the data you can fetch from a person
	- Canonical Link
	- Given Name
	- Family Name
	- Alternative Names
	- Birthday
	- Website
	- Member favorites
	- More
	- Voice Acting Roles
		- The Anime
			- Name
			- Link
			- Image
		- Character
			- Name
			- Link
			- Role
			- Image
	- Anime Staff Positions
		- The Anime
			- Name
			- Link
			- Image
			- Role
	- Published Manga
		- The Manga
			- Name

### 0.1.3 alpha - May 15, 17
- Completed character fetch data
	- You can now fetch animeography, mangaography, voice actors and member favorites of that character
	```php
	$mal = new \MAL\GET;
	$character = $mal->character(1)->data;
	```

### 0.1.2 alpha - May 12, 17
- Added Character fetch, you can now get character data.
	- Yet to fetch character animeography, mangaography & voice actors
- Updated resource for synopsis of anime/manga to something more complete and easier to match, the meta og tags
- Fetching anime data did not scrape related series (forgot to add it there, woops!) where as manga method did
- Added chaining methods (return $this)
	- Note that this only works for similar type gets, for example Anime, Manga, Characters
	- So you can fetch extra stuff such as videos, episodes, reviews, etc from their own respective pages like this:
	```php
		$mal = new \MAL\GET;
		$anime = $mal->anime(1)->videos()->episode()->reviews();
	```
	- This will be slower as every method is fetching a completely new page dedicated to that data
- Simply calling the anime or manga method like this,
	```php
		$anime = $mal->anime(1)
	```
	will no longer return the data! The data will be saved to its array, which you'll need to use a new method to return it.
	The reason for this is chained methods to fetch other related data as stated above!
	```php
		$anime = $mal->anime(1)->return();
		//or
		$anime = $mail->anime(1)->data;
		//same stuff
	```
